# Mohinh package

Python toolbox in construction to assign values to a computational grid. I originaly developped this to build starting
and reference models for Electrical Resistivity Tomography inversions.

### Instructions

Select points in the figure by enclosing them within a polygon. The ending point as to be the starting point to enclose
the shape.

Press the **esc** key to start a new polygon. Hold the **shift** key to move all of the vertices. Hold the **ctrl** key
to move a single vertex.

You can use the tool ModelMaker from mohinh to interactively create prior models, and automatically save the results in
a dat file if you provide a file name. Otherwise, you can access the final results with (ModelMaker object)
.final_results and export it yourself.

Example with a backgroung value of 100:

```
mm = ModelMaker(blocks=blocks, values_log=1, bck=100)
```

```
my_model = rfwm.final_results
```
